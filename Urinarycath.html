<br><p  style="font-size:40px;line-height:20px;margin-bottom:10;text-align:center">URINARY CATHETERIZATION</p>
<br><p  style="font-size:20px;line-height:30px;">Urinary catheterization refers to the insertion of a catheter tube through the urethra and into the bladder to drain urine. Although not a particularly complex skill, urethral catheterization can be difficult to master. Both male and female catheterizations present unique challenges.

<br>Having adequate lighting and visualization is helpful, but does not ensure entrance of the catheter into the female urethra. It is not uncommon for the catheter to enter the vagina. Leaving the catheter in the vagina can assist in the correct insertion of a new catheter into the urethra, but you must remember to remove the one in the vagina.

<br>For some women, the supine lithotomy position can be very uncomfortable or even dangerous. For example, patients in the last trimester of pregnancy may faint with decreased blood supply to the fetus in this position. Patients with arthritis of the knees and hips may also find this position extremely uncomfortable. Catheterization may also be accomplished with the patient in the lateral to Sims position (three-quarters prone).</p>

<p  style="font-size:20px;line-height:30px;">CATHETER-ASSOCIATED URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS
Catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) are a common complication of indwelling urinary catheters and have been associated with increased morbidity, mortality, hospital cost, and length of stay (Gould et al., 2009). Urinary drainage systems are often reservoirs for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) and a source of the transmission of microorganisms to other patients (Gould et al., 2009). The most important risk factor for developing a CAUTI, a health care associated infection (HAI), is the prolonged use of a urinary catheter (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC], 2015). Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are the most commonly reported HAIs in acute care hospitals and account for more than 30% of all reported infections (Gould et al., 2009). Catheters in place for more than a few days place the patient at risk for a CAUTI. A health care provider must assess patients for signs and symptoms of CAUTIs and report immediately to the primary health care provider. Signs and symptoms of a CAUTI include:<br>

<br>Fever, chills
<br>Lethargy
<br>Lower abdominal pain
<br>Back or flank pain
<br>Urgency, frequency of urination
<br>Painful urination
<br>Hematuria
<br>Change in mental status (confusion, delirium, or agitation), most commonly seen in older adults
<br>
<br><p  style="font-size:30px;line-height:20px;margin-bottom:10">The following are practices for preventing CAUTIs (Perry et al., 2014):</p>

<br><p  style="font-size:20px;line-height:20px;margin-bottom:10">1. Insert urinary catheters using sterile technique.
<br>2. Only insert indwelling catheters when essential, and remove as soon as possible.
<br>3. Use the narrowest tube size (gauge) possible.
<br>4. Provide daily cleansing of the urethral meatus with soap and water or perineal cleanser, following agency policy.
<br>5. Ensure a closed drainage system.
<br>6. Ensure that no kinks or blockages occur in the tubing.
<br>7. Secure the catheter tube to prevent urethral damage.
<br>8. Avoid use of antiseptic solutions on the urethral meatus and/or in the urinary bag.
